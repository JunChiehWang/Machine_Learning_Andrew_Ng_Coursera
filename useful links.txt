The following notes represent a complete, stand alone interpretation of Stanford's machine learning course presented by Professor Andrew Ng and originally posted on the ml-class.org website during the fall 2011 semester. The topics covered are shown below, although for a more detailed summary see lecture 19. The only content not covered here is the Octave/MATLAB programming.
